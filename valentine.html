            Thank you for being my Valentine's Jane.  I know I say it a lot but I truly do like you so much, I have never gotten this close with someone in such a short amount of time, and it always baffles me when I think about it.  I really believe we have a happy future together, maybe I'm getting aheead of myself but I know I'm the man that's going to make you happy.  Something about you has just took a hold of me and I don't want to let it go, I know you're still scared or sometimes our feelings get the better of us but I genuinely mean it when I say you're mine and you're going to be mine forever cari√±o, and I'm going to be yours :)
