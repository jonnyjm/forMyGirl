            Thank you for being my Valentine's Jane.  I know I say it a lot but I truly do like you so much, I have never gotten this close with someone in such a short amount of time, and it always baffles me when I think about it.  Something about you has just took a hold of me and I don't want to let it go, be it your kindness or your sweetness or how you just seem to understand me.  I'm not the type to get like this over someone, but I'm glad that it was with you. I know you're still scared or sometimes our feelings get the better of us but I genuinely mean it when I say you're mine and you're going to be mine forever cari√±o.  I'll make you happy love, and I'll always take care of you.  For the 14th I'm going to make sure you have the best Valentine's Day ever, it's one of our many firsts <3
